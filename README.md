ReadMe is here to help you create an stale developer hub that makes your APIs easy to use — and gives you visibility into API usage for better developer support. With ReadMe, your developers have the guidance they need to get started with your API quickly and easily troubleshoot issues along the way!  Part of what makes a developer hub great is great documentation, and our easy-to-use tool helps you build out that documentation, and so much more!  Each developer <[glossary:hub](glossary:hub)> that you publish on ReadMe is considered a project. In your project, your team can add an interactive API reference, guides, a changelog, and any other documentation your developers might need. ReadMe’s intuitive editing and publishing interface allows your team to collaborate to keep everything up to date.  Just a note that we’ll often refer to “docs”, as in _“writing your docs”_, and that’s just shorthand for documentation!
